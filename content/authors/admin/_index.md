I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University. I hold a M.S. Degree from University of Southern California and a B.E. Degree from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology. My primary research interests include autonomous robot planning and reinforcement learning. I have worked on visual odometry tasks with FlowNet pretrained structure and LSTM models when visiting Boston University.
